IFR => Índice de Força Relativa in Brazilian Portuguese. It means Relative Strenght Index, the well-known RSI. This setup is very popular among Stock Exchange traders in Brazil. IFR2 is a simple and objective setup recommended for a daily timeframe.

It uses the RSI for the last 2 (two) periods. You buy the close of the day if RSI is below a threshold, usually 10 ou even 5. The take-profit target is the max value of the last two periods. You should update this target every day that it is not reached.

There is no stop-loss. The exit is by the target, even with loss. Finally, you should close all positions seven days older.

There is a variant by Larry Connors that will be included here soon.

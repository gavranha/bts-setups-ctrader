The moving averages crossover is a kind of 'hello world' on trading.

A buy signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average and a sell signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average. 

There is no take-profit. The exit signal is generated by the opposite signal. We can have only one position at a time.

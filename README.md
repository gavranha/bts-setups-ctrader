# Setups For cTrader

This is a collection of well-known trading setups for backtest.

Each setup has its own README about the code and a GitHub page about the setup.

None of these setups are ready for trading. None of them has money management or risk management.

The purpose of this repo is to help non-developers to get started backtesting with cTrader.

Enjoy!
